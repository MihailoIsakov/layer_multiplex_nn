Activation LUT takes addresses from neurons, and returns values from the activation lut.
The module takes all the addresses in parallel, and serially processes them.

The model receives n addresses, where n is the max number of neurons, along with the number of 
neurons and validity of addresses. Returns the activations for those addresses, with activation
validity.

Issues:
    1. Should the output be valid one by one, or all at once? 
       If they are valid one by one, the neurons that are done can start loading the next values,
       so we get higher throughput.
