The single layer backpropagation only uses the error_fetcher and weight_controller module, NOT the error_propagator.
I'm measuring the time between two positive edges of certain signals.

After warming up:

Backpropagation module:
    weights_valid -> weights_valid: 11 CC

Error_fetcher consists of target_bram, two activation LUTs, a vector_subtract and vector_dot_module.
Error fetcher has two inputs: the sample, and the neuron sum z.
    delta_output_valid -> delta_output_valid: 11 CC

    LUT time, from valid input to valid output: 4 CC.
    vector_subtract time: from valid activation (latter of two inputs) to valid output: 3 CC.
        One clock cycle likely is lost in the FIFO state machine
    vector_dot time: 8 CC


Weight controller:
    w_valid -> w_valid: 11 CC

    Weight controller consists of a LUT, weight_updater, and a BRAM

    Weight_updater:
        result_valid -> result_valid: 11 CC

        weight_controller requires 3 inputs: a, delta, and w. W arrives latest, so:
        w_valid -> result_valid: 13 CC
